# Search for the best office to go
### The idea of this project is to choose between Amsterdam, Budapest and Madrid. Weather and Flight price are taking into consideration.

## Items that could and should be improved

* Layout
* Write code for the error scenarios
* Extract city name strings to constants and maybe change the code to make it easier to add other cities
* Calculate the best price with best weather between all options in all cities
* Write tests at least for the core funtionalities like the `useBestOffice`, `useRequestOfficeflights` and `useRequestofficeweather` hooks
* Refactor code by extracting similar functions to shared ones
